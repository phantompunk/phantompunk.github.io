# Hey! I'm ***Rigo***

I'm a *software* engineer who builds products, mostly focused on backend and lots of CLIs. Previously I worked at ***Ippon*** as a generalist working across the stack from microservices and data pipelines, to infrastructure.

I'm always learning something new and trying to share what I've picked up (mostly for my future self).

I'm currently **looking for my next challenge**. If you want to talk shop or collaborate you can:
- find me on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rigomoran.com) or [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigomoran/)
- read my code on [github](https://github.com/phantompunk)
- read about what I just learned at [til](/til/)
- or reach me directly via [email](mailto:hi@rigo.cc)
