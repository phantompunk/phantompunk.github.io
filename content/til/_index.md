# Things I've learned

A collection of blurbs on everyday things I've discovered or simply don't want to forget. Some solutions are my own; others are snippets and wisedom I've picked up from engineers much smarter than me. 

This is my way of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), heavily inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), and [things i’ve learned](https://leebyron.com/til/#things-i-ve-learned).
