## Jobs

I currently work at **[Ippon Technologies](https://ipponusa.com/)** a boutique global consulting firm delivering cloud, data, and software engineering solutions. During my time I’ve worked on several client projects in varying industries, capacities, and tech stacks.

Some of the clients include:

* [**Capital One**](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/) is a large tech-driven bank. I worked for them on a couple of different projects. For their CardTech Team, I helped redesign a Java Spring Boot service to improve resilience and readability. On their Anti-Money Laundering team, I wrote an AWS Lambda function using Go to automate the removal of outdated records. Learned about the concurrent capabilities of Go. Also wrote a bulk delete feature in fraud detection platform using Scala / Akka. 
* [**CIBT**](https://cibtvisas.com/) helps businesses with visas for work and travel. I helped modernize their data platform. I wrote data extraction scripts using Python. Built out the Snowflake ingestion using Snowpipes.
* [**The Motley Fool**](https://www.fool.com/) an investment advisory firm. I had the opportunity to move between multiple teams and wear several hats. On the BI side, I created SQL reports and data pipelines in Airflow. As a SWE I built AWS Lambdas using Python and contributed to shared libraries. On the Platform side, I helped migrate the Lambda infra to use [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework) and GitHub Actions. Also helped manage their Airflow cluster on Kubernetes. Started work on Developer tooling to speed up Lambda development.
* [**Qomplx**](https://www.qomplx.com/) is a risk analytics platform. This was a long project that kept evolving and the work changed with it. While on the Platform team, I worked on a REST API to manage and access their Cassandra cluster. I rolled out Casskop a Kubernetes operator for C* to help manage deployments. I built a custom K8s operator to manage deployments for our REST API. On the Data team, I worked on an Event-Driven platform to trigger security scans and analysis. I wrote Lambda functions using Python. Helped ingest vulnerability data using PySpark on EMR. Also designed C* schemas and API access patterns for vulnerability data.

Before **Ippon**, I worked at:

* Perfect Sense Digital, **now** [**Brightspot**](https://www.brightspot.com/) an enterprise-ready CMS. I worked on the Services Team customizing the FE & BE to meet the client’s needs. Most FE work involved vanilla JS and HTML templating. The BE was a custom Java-based framework based around an MVVM architecture. One of the cooler parts of the job was writing a Platform-level Calendar plugin.
  

During my undergrad I worked at:

* [**Ippon Technologies**](https://ipponusa.com/) as an intern. We worked on a real estate marketplace powered by the Ethereum blockchain. And created a blockchain data access layer for our Spring app. Wrote smart contract chain code using Go. And wired up the Angular frontend to Spring endpoints.
  
* **Gallium Technologies, now** [**AnsoniaCredit by Equifax**](https://ansoniacreditdata.com/index.html) went through a series of acquisitions after I left. It automated the collections process by accessing customer payment portals directly. I mostly wrote web scrapers in Java. Hotfixing and maintenance were a large part of the job.
