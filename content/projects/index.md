## Jobs

I currently work at [Ippon Technologies](https://ipponusa.com/) a boutique global consulting firm delivering cloud, data, and software engineering. During my time I’ve worked on several client projects in varying industries, capacities, and stacks.

Some of the clients include:

* [**Capital One**](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/) is a large tech-driven bank. I worked with them on a couple of different projects. On their Anti-Money Laundering team, I wrote an AWS Lambda function in Go and learned more about the concurrent capabilities of Go (Also built the deployment infrastructure). Also wrote a bulk delete feature in a real-time fraud detection platform in Scala. For their Card Tech Team, I helped redesign a Spring Boot microservice to improve resilience and increase readability.
    
* [**CIBT**](https://cibtvisas.com/) helps businesses with visas for work and travel. I helped modernize their data platform. Wrote data extraction scripts in Python. Built out Snowflake ingestion integrations.
    
* [**The Motley Fool**](https://www.fool.com/) an investment advisory firm. Created data pipelines in Airflow. Built AWS Lambdas. Redesigned their Lambda infra to use Serverless Framework and GitHub Actions. Managed their Airflow cluster on Kubernetes. Helped migrate to FluxCD to support GitOps workflows for K8s. Started work on Developer tooling to speed up Lambda development.
    
* [**Qomplx**](https://www.qomplx.com/) is a risk analytics platform. This was a long project that kept evolving the work scope changed with it. While on the Platform team, I worked on REST API for managing and accessing their Cassandra cluster. I migrated C\* operations to the Casskop Operator. Wrote custom K8s Operator to manage REST API deployments. Then for the Data team, I worked on an Event-Driven Lambda architecture to run cybersecurity scans and analysis. Wrote Lambdas in Python. Worked on ingesting vulnerability data using PySpark on EMR. Built table schemas and access patterns for an API.
    

Before **Ippon**, I worked at:

* Perfect Sense Digital, **now** [**Brightspot**](https://www.brightspot.com/) an enterprise-ready CMS. I worked on the Services Team customizing the FE & BE to meet the client’s needs. Most FE work involved vanilla JS and HTML templating. The BE was a custom Java-based framework based around an MVVM architecture. One of the cooler parts of the job was writing a Platform-level Calendar plugin.
    

During my undergrad I worked at:

* [**Ippon Technologies**](https://ipponusa.com/) as an intern. We worked on a real estate marketplace powered by the Ethereum blockchain. And created a blockchain data access layer for our Spring app. Wrote smart contract chain code using Go. And wired up the Angular frontend to Spring endpoints.
    
* **Gallium Technologies, now** [**AnsoniaCredit**](https://ansoniacreditdata.com/index.html) went through a series of acquisitions a few years after I left, and now it’s been acquired by [**Equifax**](https://www.equifax.com/). It automated the collections process by accessing custom payment portals directly. I mostly wrote web scrapers in Java. Hotfixing and maintenance were a large part of the job.
